## Software

### Vocabulary Generators

*Software to help generate vocabulary for a language based on specific inputted guidelines and restrictions.*

- **[Gen](http://www.zompist.com/gen.html)** and **[Phono](http://www.zompist.com/phono.html)**. Simple, category-based word generator with support for phoneme frequency.
- **[Awkwords](http://akana.conlang.org/tools/awkwords/)**. A category-based word generator capable of complex word and syllable structures and manual phoneme frequency probability.
- **[Wordo Word Generator](http://wordgenerator.wakayos.com/)**. A fully programmable word generator.
- **[Lexifer](https://lingweenie.org/conlang/lexifer.html)**. A category-based generator not unlike gen, but with further improvements like cluster tables. **Python 2.7**
- **[Coffeebot Syllable Generator](http://coffeebot.net/conlang/)**. A very user-friendly generator.

### Sound change appliers

*Software for simulating and applying historical sound changes.*

- **[Didelphis SCA](https://github.com/samanthamccabe/didelphis-sca)**. A powerful SCA with built in IPA support, polygraphs, position changes and a phonetic feature system, as well as multiple outputs.
- **[Geoff's SCA]()**. A powerful SCA capable of handling complex rules, assimilation and position changes, as well as multiple outputs and nondeterministic changes.
- **[SCA<sup>2</sup>](https://www.zompist.com/sca2.html)**. The SCA counterpart to Gen and Phono. Simple but capable.
- **[Versatile SCA](http://members.home.nl/par/vsca/vsca.htm)**. Similar to SCA<sup>2</sup> but with support for more complex environments and conditions.
- **[Reversible SCA](http://000024.org/rsca.html)**. A SCA capable of reverting changes (up to a degree) and reconstruct proto-words from a changed input.

### Phonology and Language generators

*Software that generates phonetic inventories, grammar and/or syntax.*

- **[Colorless Language Generator](http://kyrete.conlang.org/resources/colorless.html)**. Randomly generates a basic phonology and grammar.
- **[Vulgarlang](vulgarlang.com/)** (freemium). Built on top of Colorless, a much more powerful and friendly generator that accepts many generation options and restrictions, including saving and loading old settings and seeds.
- **[gleb](gleb.000024.org/)**. A random phonology generator, it can output a wide range of sounds, syllable structures, interesting allophonic rules, and a list of potential words.

### Translators

- **[Lingjam](https://lingojam.com/)**. A translator building tool

### Language and vocabulary managers

*Apps and services to help the conlanger keep track of their creations*

- **[Linguifex](https://linguifex.com/wiki/Main_Page)**. Mediawiki based wiki meant for conlangs.
- **[ConWorkShop](https://conworkshop.com/)**. A tools website and community hosting forums, word generators, word banks, lexical field vocabulary sets and more.
- **[Polyglot](https://github.com/DraqueT/PolyGlot)**. Suit of tools to store and organize vocabulary and grammar.

### Analysis tools

- **[The Frequentizer](http://akana.conlang.org/tools/frequentizer.html)**. "This is a Javascript tool for analyzing phoneme frequencies in a language".
